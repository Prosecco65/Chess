          <h2>Rules of chess!</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Originating in India around the 6th century AD, chess came to Europe around the year 1000, thanks to the Arabs. <br>
            Chess is played on an 8x8 board with a total of 64 squares on which 16 white pieces and 16 black pieces face off. <br>
            The pieces are divided into 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen and a king, each moving differently. <br>
            The white pieces start the game. <br>
            The pieces can eat the opponent's pieces except for the king, which cannot be eaten. <br>
            The goal is to checkmate the king, that is, to block all possible moves. <br>
            When the king is in checkmate he is obliged to move.</p>
